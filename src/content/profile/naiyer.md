ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a software engineer from India. This website is my personal platform where I discuss topics such as software engineering, spirituality, psychedelics, archaelogy and any subject that piques my interest. 

I'm just a regular guy, you know? I mean, I'm Sumeet, and I'm all about exploring the uncharted territories of the mind, man. I've got this fascination with  ~~psychedelics~~ and I just can't help but dive into those deep waters of consciousness. But it's not just about the mind, it's about the body too. I've got this crazy love for MMA. It's like a primal dance of combat, a beautiful chaos, you know? it's a constant journey of self-discovery and discipline.  So, if you're into exploring the depths of your consciousness, the intensity of MMA, and the mysteries of our human history, well, you're in good company. Welcome to this website, my friend!

### Have you people ever really sat down and thought about pyramids, like the ones in Egypt?

:::deter{title=Pyramids}
 How the heck did they build these things with such precision thousands of years ago, without any modern machinery or technology? I mean, I can barely code without messing it up __(just kidding)__, and these folks managed to stack massive stone blocks so perfectly it's like they had the original 'LEGO: Pyramid Edition. And what were they even for? Tombs? Power plants? Spaceships for interstellar travel? Ancient alien charging stations, perhaps? Who knows! But one thing's for sure, there's some deep, ancient wisdom hidden in those structures.
