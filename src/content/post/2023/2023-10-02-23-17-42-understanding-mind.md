Mind's nature is to move from one extreme to another. It depends on imbalance. If you are balanced, mind disappears. Mind is like a disease: when you are imbalanced it is there, when you are balanced, it is not there.

## Mind and `Time`

__Time__ is created by the movement of the mind, just like the movement of the pendulum. Mind moves, you feel time. When mind is nonmoving, how can you feel time? When there is no movement, time cannot be felt. Scientists and mystics agree on this point: that movement creates the phenomenon of time. If you are not moving, if you are still, time disappears, eternity comes into existence. And what is the furthest, the most distant? The opposite is the most distant. You love a person -- now hatred is the most distant phenomenon; you are overeating -- now fasting is the most distant phenomenon; you are celibate -- now sex is the most distant phenomenon; you are a king -- now to be a monk is the most distant phenomenon. 

Distant, never for the near. The near gives you boredom; you are fed up with it. The distant gives you dreams, hopes, the possibility of pleasure. So the mind always thinks of the distant. It is always somebody else's wife who is attractive and beautiful. It is always somebody else's house that obsesses you. It is always somebody else's car that fascinates you. It is always the distant. You are blind to the near. The mind cannot see that which is very near. It can only see that which is very far.

And what is the furthest, the most distant? The opposite is the most distant. You love a person; now hatred is the most distant phenomenon. You are overeating; now fasting is the most distant phenomenon. You are celibate; now sex is the most distant phenomenon. You are a king; now to be a monk is the most distant phenomenon. The most distant is the most dreamy. It attracts, it obsesses, it goes on calling, inviting you. And then when you have reached the other pole, this place from where you have traveled will become beautiful again. Divorce your wife, and after a few years, the wife has again gained beauty.

## The Two Minds

There are two types of mind in the world: the mind of those who dominate -- the male mind, and the mind of those who like to be dominated -- the female mind. By female I don't mean women, or by male, men. There are women who have masculine minds and there are men who have feminine minds. They are not always the same. These are the two types of mind: one which likes to dominate and one which likes to be dominated. In both ways ego is fulfilled because whether you dominate or are dominated YOU are important. If someone dominates you, then too you are important, because his domination depends on you. Without you, where will he be? Without you, where will his kingdom be, his domination, his possession? Without you, ~~he~~ will be nobody.

### Desire to Rule

The desire to rule comes from the ego; the desire to possess, to be powerful, the desire to dominate, comes from the ego. The greater the kingdom you can dominate, the greater the ego you can achieve. With your possessions, your inner somebody goes on becoming bigger and bigger and bigger. Sometimes the boat becomes very small because the ego becomes so big. This is what is happening to politicians, to people obsessed with wealth, prestige, power.

Their egos become so big that their boats cannot contain them. Every moment they are on the point of drowning, on the verge, afraid, scared to death. And the more afraid you are, the more possessive you become because you think that through possessions somehow security is achieved. The more afraid you are, the more you think that if your kingdom could be a little greater, you would be more secure.

## Empty Boat by Chuang Tzu

_If a man is crossing a river_
_And an empty boat collides with his own skiff,_
_Even though he be a bad-tempered man_
_He will not become very angry._
_But if he sees a man in the boat,_
_He will shout at him to steer clear._
_If the shout is not heard, he will shout again,_
_And yet again, and begin cursing._
_And all because there is somebody in the boat._
_Yet if the boat were empty._
_He would not be shouting, and not angry._
                                 **_-Chuang Tzu_**
