`Psilocybin` is a psychedelic compound that is found in some mushrooms. It has been used for centuries by indigenous cultures for spiritual and healing purposes. Recently, psilocybin has also attracted scientific attention for its potential to treat various mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

The study involved 12 healthy volunteers who received a single high dose of psilocybin (25 mg/70 kg) in a controlled setting. The researchers measured their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and their emotional state using self-report questionnaires before, one week after, and one month after the psilocybin session.

The results showed that psilocybin had lasting effects on both the brain and the emotions of the participants. One week after the psilocybin session, the participants reported lower levels of negative emotions, such as sadness, anger, and fear, and higher levels of positive emotions, such as happiness, joy, and excitement. They also showed lower activity in the amygdala, a brain region that is involved in processing emotional stimuli, especially negative ones. These changes suggest that psilocybin may reduce the sensitivity to negative emotions and enhance the mood of the users.

But how does psilocybin work in the brain and what are its long-term effects on emotions and cognition? A new study published in [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59282-y.pdf) by researchers from Johns Hopkins University and the Kennedy Krieger Institute sheds some light on these questions.

One month after the psilocybin session, the participants still reported higher levels of positive emotions and lower levels of trait anxiety, which is a tendency to experience anxiety across different situations. They also showed increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), two brain regions that are involved in cognitive control and decision making. These changes suggest that psilocybin may improve the ability to regulate emotions and cope with emotionally conflicting situations.

Moreover, the study found that psilocybin increased the number of functional connections between different brain regions, both one week and one month after the session. This means that psilocybin may enhance the communication and integration of information across the brain, which could lead to more flexible and creative thinking.

The study is one of the first to investigate the long-term effects of psilocybin on the brain and emotions using fMRI. The findings are consistent with previous studies that showed that psilocybin can induce positive changes in personality, such as increased openness and self-transcendence23, and in mental health, such as reduced depression and anxiety4 . The study also provides new insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie these changes, which could help develop better treatments for mood and substance use disorders.
